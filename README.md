cd backend
```

2. Install the necessary dependencies :

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the server :

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. To access the currency conversion API, use the following URL :

```

4. Open your browser and go to the following URL :

```
http://localhost:3000
```

By following these steps, you'll be able to properly install and configure both the backend and frontend of the application to start working on it

## API Key Management

To secure your API key and keep it out of your source code, you can use a `.env`file. Here's how to proceed :

1. Navigate to the backend directory of your project using the following command in your terminal :
   
```bash
cd backend
```

2. Install the necessary packages, including Express.js and dotenv, by running the following command :

```bash
npm install express dotenv --save
```

3. Create a `.env` file at the root of your project using the following command :

```bash
touch .env
```

4. Add your API key to the `.env` file using the following command :

```bash
echo 'APIKEY=votre_clÃ©_d_api'> .env
```

By following these steps, you will secure your API key and be able to use it securely in your application.

## Running Tests

1. Make sure the server is running by executing the following command in your terminal :

```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Navigate to the backend directory :

```bash
cd backend
```

3. Run the following command to launch the tests :

```bash
